/* Enhancements to Exceed Requirements:
    
    1. Support for Multiple Scriptures:
       - The program supports a library of 5 scriptures instead of a single scripture.
       - Scriptures are randomly selected at the start of the program, adding variety and replayability.

    2. Enhanced User Experience:
       - Added formatting to improve readability, such as separating the scripture text and reference with line breaks.
       - Included helpful messages like "All words hidden! Congratulations!" at the end.

    3. Structured Code for Extensibility:
       - The code is modular, with encapsulated classes for `Word`, `Reference`, and `Scripture`.
       - Itâ€™s easy to add new features or extend functionality, such as loading scriptures from a file.

    These enhancements make the program more engaging, interactive, and user-friendly, ensuring it goes beyond the basic requirements.
